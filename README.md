# Python-Web-Scraping

# About the Project
This project is a simple web scraper that browses through https://pokemondb.net/ to retrieve data on Pokemon attacks, items, abilities, or Pokemon. The web scraper was integrated with a Discord bot which allows users to search for the information on their own in a server using commands.

# Purpose
The purpose of the project was to allow me to have an easier way to look up data regarding certain Pokemon strategies while I practice for competitive Pokemon events.

# Data is returned in the following formats

## Insert pictures here to show examples
